477 Points in Figures: Rectangles and Circles
Given a list of figures (rectangles and circles) and a list of points in the x-y plane, determine for each
point which figures (if any) contain the point.
Input
There will be n(¡Ü 10) figures descriptions, one per line. The first character will designate the type of
figure (¡°r¡±, ¡°c¡± for rectangle or circle, respectively). This character will be followed by values which
describe that figure.
? For a rectangle, there will be four real values designating the x-y coordinates of the upper left
and lower right corners.
? For a circle, there will be three real values, designating the x-y coordinates of the center and the
radius.
The end of the list will be signalled by a line containing an asterisk in column one.
The remaining lines will contain the x-y coordinates, one per line, of the points to be tested. The
end of this list will be indicated by a point with coordinates 9999.9 9999.9; these values should not be
included in the output.
Points coinciding with a figure border are not considered inside.
Output
For each point to be tested, write a message of the form:
Point i is contained in figure j
for each figure that contains that point. If the point is not contained in any figure, write a message of
the form:
Point i is not contained in any figure
Points and figures should be numbered in
the order in which they appear in the input.
Note: See the picture on the right for a diagram
of these figures and data points.
